# A New Chapter for the IoT Club

Welcome to the brand new **Learning Hub** of the GCET IoT Club! We've heard your feedback, and we understand that while hackathons and events are exciting, continuous learning is the true key to mastering hardware and software.

## What to Expect Here
Every week, a member of our core team or a special guest will drop a new blog post. We will cover a variety of topics including:
- **Project Breakdowns:** Step-by-step guides on how we built some of our most complex projects.
- **Hardware Spotlights:** Deep dives into specific sensors, microcontrollers (like ESP32 and Arduino), and communication protocols (MQTT, LoRa).
- **Software Integration:** How to connect your hardware to the cloud, build React dashboards, and use platforms like Supabase.

We want this space to be deeply interactive and valuable. If you have a specific topic you want us to cover, drop a message in the WhatsApp group!

Stay curious, keep building, and see you next week!
